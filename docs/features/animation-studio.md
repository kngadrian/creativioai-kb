## Animation Prompt Tips

Writing effective animation prompts is key to getting great results. Here are some tips:

### ✅ Do
- **Describe the motion**: *"Slow dolly forward toward the product"*
- **Set the mood**: *"Warm golden hour lighting with soft lens flare"*
- **Mention camera work**: *"Orbiting 360° shot around the box"*
- **Include environment details**: *"On a marble table with city skyline in background"*

### ❌ Avoid
- Vague prompts: *"Make it look nice"*
- Contradictory instructions: *"Fast zoom in while staying still"*
- Excessive detail that conflicts with the chosen style

### Example Prompts

**Product Reveal:**
> "Slow cinematic push-in on a software box sitting on a reflective dark surface. Volumetric light beams from above, subtle particle dust floating in the air, dramatic reveal feeling."

**Social Media Reel:**
> "Dynamic 360-degree orbit around the product, colorful gradient background transitioning from purple to teal, energetic motion with quick zoom at the end."

**Lifestyle Scene:**
> "Camera slowly pans across a creative workspace, product box centered on desk next to laptop and coffee, morning sunlight streaming through window, cozy productive atmosphere."

---

## Negative Prompts

Use the **Negative Prompt** field to exclude unwanted elements from your animation:

- `blurry, distorted, low quality` — General quality safeguard
- `text, watermark, logo` — Prevent unwanted text overlays
- `dark, underexposed` — Keep the lighting bright
- `shaky, jittery` — Ensure smooth camera movement

---

## Workflow Tips

1. **Start with Fast mode** to test your prompt and style, then switch to Quality for the final render
2. **Use Image to Video** with your best photoshoot result for product animations
3. **Combine with AI Magic Tools** — enhance or upscale an image before animating it
4. **Use Extend Video** to build longer sequences from short clips you like
5. **Save to Assets** — all generated videos are automatically saved to Your Assets
