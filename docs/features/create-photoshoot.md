## Where to find it

## What you need before you start
- 1–3 clean product photos (PNG/JPG/WebP)
  - best: front-facing, well-lit, minimal blur
- A clear idea of the scene (studio, lifestyle, outdoor, cinematic, etc.)

!!! tip "Start simple"
    Use **Standard (1K)** + **Fast iteration** first. Once you like the direction, switch to higher quality/resolution.

## Step-by-step tutorial

### 1) Upload your product images
- Drag & drop into the upload area ("Drop product images here")
- Or click to browse
- You can also use **Select from Asset Library** to reuse existing assets

Notes:
- Supports JPG, PNG, WebP
- UI indicates **Max 10 images**

### 2) Describe the scene (Prompt Editor)
In **Prompt Editor**, write what you want the final photo to look like.

Good prompt template:
- *Environment:* "on a marble kitchen counter"
- *Lighting:* "soft natural window light"
- *Camera:* "50mm product shot, shallow depth of field"
- *Mood/branding:* "clean, premium, ecommerce-ready"
