## Where to find it
- Sidebar → **Create Photoshoot**
- URL: `/create`

## What you need before you start
- 1–3 clean product photos (PNG/JPG/WebP)
  - best: front-facing, well-lit, minimal blur
- A clear idea of the scene (studio, lifestyle, outdoor, cinematic, etc.)

!!! tip "Start simple"
    Use **Standard (1K)** + **Fast iteration** first. Once you like the direction, switch to higher quality/resolution.

## Step-by-step tutorial

### 1) Upload your product images
- Drag & drop into the upload area ("Drop product images here")
- Or click to browse
- You can also use **Select from Asset Library** to reuse existing assets

Notes:
- Supports JPG, PNG, WebP
- UI indicates **Max 10 images**

### 2) Describe the scene (Prompt Editor)
In **Prompt Editor**, write what you want the final photo to look like.

Good prompt template:
- *Environment:* "on a marble kitchen counter"
- *Lighting:* "soft natural window light"
- *Camera:* "50mm product shot, shallow depth of field"
- *Mood/branding:* "clean, premium, ecommerce-ready"

Example:
> Studio product photo of the item on a white seamless backdrop, softbox lighting, crisp shadows, ultra-clean ecommerce look.

### 3) Choose a style (Creative Style Engine)
Pick a category and a style preset.

Categories observed:
- Product & E-Commerce
- Brand & Marketing
- Cinematic & Editorial
- Creative & Trending

### 4) (Optional) Special Days Templates
Use these when you want holiday/seasonal creatives quickly (e.g., Valentine’s templates).

### 5) (Optional) Advanced Tweaks
Toggle **Advanced Tweaks (Colors, Composition, Mood)** when you want more control.

### 6) Set generation settings
**Aspect Ratio** options observed:
- 1:1, 2:3, 3:2, 3:4, 4:3, 4:5, 5:4, 9:16, 16:9, 21:9

**Image Quality** options observed:
- Standard (1K)
- High (2K)
- Ultra (4K)

### 7) Use a negative prompt (recommended)
The negative prompt helps reduce common issues.

Example negatives:
- `blurry, distorted, warped text, extra objects, low quality, oversharpened`

### 8) Generate
Click **Generate Photoshoot**.

If the button is disabled:
- confirm at least one image is uploaded
- confirm you wrote a prompt

## Troubleshooting

### My results don’t look like my product
- Use a cleaner source image (front-facing, higher resolution)
- Add prompt constraints like: "preserve product shape and colors"

### The background is messy
- Use a simpler prompt (studio backdrop)
- Add negative prompts ("clutter, messy background")
