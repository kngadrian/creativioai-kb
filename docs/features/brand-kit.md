# Brand Kit

**Brand Kit** lets you define your brand's visual identity in one place. Once configured, CreativioAI uses your brand settings to ensure every AI-generated image and video stays consistent with your brand guidelines.

:::tip Why It Matters
Without a Brand Kit, every generation starts from scratch. With one, the AI knows your colors, your style, your voice — and every output feels like *yours*.

## Sections

Brand Kit is organized into four sections, each controlling a different aspect of your visual identity.

### 🏷️ Brand Identity

![Brand Identity Section](/img/brand-kit/section-identity.png)

The foundation of your brand — who you are and how you communicate.

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Brand Name** | Your company or product name | `Creativio AI` |
| **Website** | Your brand's website URL | `creativio.ai` |
| **Brand Description / Voice** | Describe your brand's personality, tone, and target audience | *"Modern, bold, creative-focused. Targets digital marketers and e-commerce brands. Tone is professional yet approachable."* |

**How it's used:**
- The AI references your brand name and voice when generating creative content
- Your description helps shape the mood and style of generated images
- Particularly useful when using **Prompt Editor** or **Magic Mode** in Create Photoshoot

**Tips:**
- Be specific about your tone: "playful and youthful" vs. "luxury and sophisticated" produces very different results
- Mention your target audience — it helps the AI choose appropriate scenes and aesthetics
- Include key adjectives that define your brand personality

### 🎨 Logo & Watermark

![Logo & Watermark Section](/img/brand-kit/section-logo.png)

Upload your logo and configure how it appears on generated images.

#### Upload Logo
- Accepts **PNG** (with transparent background) and **SVG** formats
- Click the upload area or drag & drop your logo file
- Transparent backgrounds work best for overlay placement

#### Default Logo Position

Choose where your logo appears on generated images using a **position grid**. Options include:

| Position | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| **Top-Left** | Standard watermark placement |
| **Top-Center** | Header-style branding |
| **Top-Right** | Social media style |
| **Center** | Bold watermark (use with transparency) |
| **Bottom-Left** | Subtle corner branding |
| **Bottom-Center** | Footer-style placement |
| **Bottom-Right** | Most common commercial placement |

#### Logo Size

| Size | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Small** | Subtle watermarks, product-focused images |
| **Normal** | Balanced visibility, general marketing |
| **Large** | Bold branding, social media covers |

**Tips:**
- Use SVG logos when possible — they scale perfectly at any size
- For product photography, **Small + Bottom-Right** keeps focus on the product
- For social media posts, **Normal + Top-Left** provides clear brand attribution

### 🎨 Color Palette

![Color Palette Section](/img/brand-kit/section-colors.png)

Define your brand colors so the AI can match them in generated content.

**How to use:**
1. Your palette starts with default colors (you can modify or remove them)
2. Click **Add Color** to add a new color to your palette
3. Use the **color picker** or enter a **hex code** directly (e.g., `#7371FC`)
4. Add as many colors as your brand requires

**Default palette includes:**
- A primary accent color
- A secondary/highlight color
- A dark/background color

**How colors are used:**
- When **"Use Brand Kit?"** is enabled in Create Photoshoot, the AI incorporates your brand colors into backgrounds, accents, and lighting
- Color Changer tool can reference your palette for consistent recoloring
- AI Magic Studio respects your color preferences when generating compositions

**Tips:**
- Include at least 3 colors: primary, secondary, and a neutral/dark
- Add your exact hex values from your brand guidelines
- The AI uses these as *guidance* — subtle influence rather than strict color matching

---

### ✒️ Typography

![Typography Section](/img/brand-kit/section-typography.png)

Select a typography style that matches your brand's visual personality.

| Style | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Modern Sans** | Clean, contemporary sans-serif | Tech brands, startups, modern businesses |
| **Elegant Serif** | Classic, refined serif typeface | Luxury brands, editorial, fashion |
| **Bold Display** | Heavy, impactful display type | Bold marketing, headlines, sports brands |
| **Minimalist Mono** | Clean monospace typeface | Developer tools, technical brands, minimal aesthetics |

**How to use:**
- Click on the typography style that best matches your brand
- The selected style is highlighted with a border
- This influences any text the AI generates or overlays in your images

**Tips:**
- Choose **one** primary style — consistency is key
- Modern Sans is the safest choice if you're unsure
- Bold Display works great for promotional and social media content

## Using Brand Kit in Other Tools

Once your Brand Kit is configured, you can activate it across CreativioAI:

### In Create Photoshoot
Toggle **"Use Brand Kit?"** in the Generation Settings panel. When enabled:
- Generated backgrounds and scenes incorporate your brand colors
- Logo is automatically placed at your default position
- The AI considers your brand voice when interpreting prompts

### In AI Magic Studio
Your brand settings inform the AI's creative decisions when compositing and editing.

### In Animation Studio
Brand colors and style influence the mood and visual treatment of generated videos.

## Best Practices

1. **Fill out everything** — The more the AI knows about your brand, the better the results
2. **Upload a high-quality logo** — SVG is ideal; PNG should be at least 500×500px with transparency
3. **Be descriptive in your Brand Voice** — Don't just write "professional"; write *"Modern, bold, tech-forward. We speak with confidence and clarity. Our audience is creative professionals aged 25-45."*
4. **Use exact hex codes** — Don't approximate; pull colors directly from your brand guidelines
5. **Save after every change** — Click **Save Changes** at the top to persist your settings
6. **Review periodically** — As your brand evolves, update the kit to keep AI outputs aligned
