## Product Photo to Finished Ad Workflow

**Time:** 10-15 minutes  
**Tools Used:** Create Photoshoot → AI Magic Studio → Export

### Starting Point

You have: A simple product photo (ideally on white background)

You want: Professional ad creative with lifestyle background, compelling composition, and text overlay

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Prepare Your Product Image

**If you have a white background:**
- Photo is ready to use as-is
- Ensure good lighting and focus

**If you have a busy background:**
1. Go to **AI Magic Tools**
2. Upload your product photo
3. Use **Remove Background** tool
4. Download the transparent PNG

**Optimal photo specs:**
- Resolution: 1000px+ on longest side
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Well-lit, sharp focus
- Product fills 60-80% of frame

#### 2. Generate Lifestyle Backgrounds

1. Navigate to **Create Photoshoot**
2. Upload your product image
3. **Choose a visual style:**
   - **Lifestyle** - Realistic home/outdoor settings
   - **Minimalist** - Clean, modern backgrounds
   - **Luxury** - Premium, sophisticated scenes
   - **Creative** - Abstract or artistic backdrops

4. **Add a detailed prompt** (optional but recommended):
   ```
   "Modern living room with natural light, minimalist decor, 
   soft pastel colors, product on marble coffee table"
   ```

5. **Select aspect ratio** for your platform:
   - Square (1:1) - Instagram feed
   - Portrait (4:5) - Instagram/Facebook feed

   - Landscape (16:9) - Facebook ads

6. Click **Generate**

   - Click **Insert Image**
   - Upload your product (transparent background)
   - Position using **Select Tool (V)**
   - Resize to fit scene naturally

2. **Refine the composition:**
   - Use **Remove Background (Q)** if needed
   - Use **Mask Brush (B)** to blend edges
   - Add drop shadow for depth (optional)
   - Adjust product opacity if needed for subtlety

3. **Add text elements:**
   - Click **Add Text (T)**

**Platforms:** Instagram feed, Facebook ads, email header

**Performance:** 3.2% CTR (vs 1.1% baseline with white background)

## E-commerce Lifestyle Workflow

**Time:** 20 minutes for 5 lifestyle images  
**Best For:** Product pages, Amazon listings, social proof

### Why Lifestyle Shots Matter

- 78% higher conversion than white background alone
- Build emotional connection with product
- Show scale and use context
- Differentiate from competitors

### The Process

#### 1. Plan Your Shots

Decide on 3-5 lifestyle scenarios that resonate with your target customer:

**For a water bottle:**
- Gym/fitness setting
- Office desk scene
- Outdoor hiking
- Kitchen countertop
- Yoga studio

**For skincare:**
- Bathroom vanity
- Morning routine on bed
- Spa-like setting
- Natural outdoor light
- Minimalist white aesthetic

#### 2. Generate Each Scene

For each scenario:

1. **Create Photoshoot** with specific prompts:
   ```
   Scenario 1: "Water bottle on gym floor next to dumbbells and yoga mat, 
   natural gym lighting, fitness motivation aesthetic"
   
   Scenario 2: "Water bottle on modern office desk with laptop and 
   notebook, professional workspace, natural window light"
   ```

2. **Generate 4-6 variations** per scenario

3. **Select best output** that matches your brand

#### 3. Batch Process in Magic Studio

1. **Open Magic Studio**
2. **Import all selected scenes** as separate projects
3. **For each scene:**
   - Verify product looks realistic
   - Adjust lighting to match product color accuracy
   - Add subtle shadows if needed
   - Ensure product is hero (not background)

4. **Consistency check:**
   - Similar color grading across all images
   - Consistent product sizing
   - Uniform brand feel

#### 4. Create Product Page Gallery

**Image order for product page:**

1. **Hero shot** - Main product on white (if required)
2. **Lifestyle 1** - Primary use case
3. **Lifestyle 2** - Secondary use case
4. **Detail shot** - Close-up of key feature
5. **Lifestyle 3** - Aspirational scene

### Pro Tips

- Keep product same size (relative) across lifestyle shots
- Use similar lighting conditions for cohesive look
- Show product in use, not just placed in scene
- Match scene aesthetic to target customer lifestyle
- Test generations with different times of day lighting

## Social Media Series Workflow

**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Output:** 7 days of on-brand content

### Planning Your Content Calendar

**Goal:** Create a week of cohesive, varied posts that build brand recognition.

#### Week Structure Example (for product brand):

- **Monday:** Motivation quote + product
- **Tuesday:** Educational tip about product use
- **Wednesday:** User testimonial / social proof
- **Thursday:** Behind-the-scenes / brand story

### Creation Process

#### 1. Set Up Brand Consistency

1. Go to **Brand Kit**
2. Upload brand logo, fonts, color palette
3. Save as default for quick access

#### 2. Generate Scene Templates

Use **Create Photoshoot** to create base scenes:

1. **Motivational scene** - Sunrise, aspirational lifestyle
2. **Educational scene** - Clean background, focus on product
3. **Lifestyle scene** - Realistic use case
4. **Abstract scene** - Creative, colorful for quotes

**Prompt examples:**
```
Monday (Motivation): "Inspiring sunrise over mountains, golden hour, 
place for product overlay and motivational text"

Tuesday (Education): "Minimal modern background with product focused, 
clean professional aesthetic for infographic"

Friday (Lifestyle): "Weekend relaxation scene, cozy home interior, 
soft natural light, peaceful vibe"
```

#### 3. Batch Create in Magic Studio

**Set up assembly line approach:**

1. Open **Magic Studio**
2. Create 7 separate canvases (one per day)
3. Import corresponding background scenes

**For each post:**

1. **Add product image** (if applicable)
2. **Add text overlay:**
   - Day-specific message
   - Brand font from Brand Kit
   - Brand colors for consistency
3. **Add brand logo** (corner or watermark)
4. **Maintain visual consistency:**
   - Similar text placement across week
   - Consistent logo position
   - Harmonious color palette

#### 4. Export & Schedule

1. Export all 7 images (1080x1080 for Instagram)
2. Name consistently: `brandname-mon-week1.jpg`
3. Upload to scheduling tool (Buffer, Later, etc.)
4. Schedule across the week

### Content Variation Tips

**Visual variety while staying on-brand:**

- Alternate product-focused vs. scene-focused
- Mix text-heavy posts with image-only posts
- Vary color temperatures (warm/cool) throughout week
- Different aspect ratios for feed vs. stories

**Text overlay best practices:**

- Keep font size large enough (mobile viewing)
- High contrast between text and background
- Consistent text position creates brand pattern
- Limit to 5-7 words for maximum impact

## Multi-Variant Ad Testing Workflow

**Time:** 15 minutes for 6 variations  
**Use Case:** Facebook/Instagram A/B testing

### Why Test Variants?

- Different audiences respond to different visuals
- Test headlines, colors, and compositions
- Find winning creative faster
- Optimize ad spend based on performance

### Creating Test Variants

#### 1. Identify Test Variables

Choose **one variable** to test per set:

**Test A: Background Style**
- Variant 1: Minimalist white
- Variant 2: Lifestyle home scene
- Variant 3: Outdoor/nature
- Variant 4: Abstract colorful

**Test B: Headline Positioning**
- Variant 1: Top center
- Variant 2: Bottom center
- Variant 3: Left-aligned vertical
- Variant 4: No text (product only)

**Test C: Color Palette**
- Variant 1: Brand primary colors
- Variant 2: Complementary colors
- Variant 3: Monochrome
- Variant 4: Bold contrasting

#### 2. Generate Base Creatives

1. **Create Photoshoot** with multiple styles selected
2. Generate variations for each test variable
3. Select best output from each category

#### 3. Systematic Variant Creation

**Set up Magic Studio workflow:**

1. **Start with winning base creative**
2. **Save as template** (duplicate project)
3. **For each variant:**
   - Open duplicate
   - Change ONLY the test variable
   - Keep everything else identical
   - Export with clear naming

**Naming convention:**
```
brand-product-test-background-minimal.jpg
brand-product-test-background-lifestyle.jpg
brand-product-test-background-nature.jpg
brand-product-test-headline-top.jpg
brand-product-test-headline-bottom.jpg
```

#### 4. Track & Iterate

1. **Launch ad sets** with one variant each
2. **Equal budget** to each variant initially
3. **Monitor metrics:** CTR, conversions, cost per result
4. **After 2-3 days:** Identify winner
5. **Kill low performers**, scale winner
6. **Create new variants** based on winning elements

### Testing Matrix Example

| Variant | Background | Headline | CTA Button | Results |
|---------|-----------|----------|------------|---------|
| A | Lifestyle | "Transform Your Mornings" | Blue | 2.1% CTR |
| B | Minimal | "Transform Your Mornings" | Blue | 1.8% CTR |
| C | Lifestyle | "Start Your Day Right" | Blue | 3.2% CTR ⭐ |
| D | Lifestyle | "Start Your Day Right" | Green | 2.9% CTR |

**Insight:** "Start Your Day Right" headline performs better. Lifestyle background beats minimal. Blue CTA slightly better than green.

**Next test:** Try lifestyle background + winning headline with different times of day lighting.
